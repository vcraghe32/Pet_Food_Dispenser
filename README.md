# Overview
After completing the basic OnShape and CircuitPython assignments, the next assignment was the first Engineering III project. The project did not have many constraints. Its main goal was to be a challenging project. No specific task was given, but the project had to make use of CircuitPython and CAD (Computer-Aided Design).

For the first Engineering III project, we decided to create a pet food dispenser. Both having pets, a pet food dispenser sounded like an applicable and fun idea. There were not many constraints on this project. The main constraint was that the project had to be a challenge.

The tools that were used for this project are as follows:

* OnShape - OnShape was used for CAD. OnShape was helpful because it is a cloud-based program. It automatically saves work to the cloud. Working on the cloud is a useful measure against data loss. Unlike Solidworks, another CAD program, OnShape allows for collaboration at the same time.

* PyCharm - PyCharm was used for CircuitPython. PyCharm is useful in that it is compatible with GitHub commits, pushes, and pulls. It also has spell checks, a built-in serial monitor, and can suggest code improvements.

* Caret - Similar to PyCharm, Caret was used for CircuitPython. Note that **Caret is for Chromebook.** PyCharm operates only on Macs and PCs. For Chromebooks, Caret is a useful piece of software for programming in CircuitPython. It does not have a built-in serial monitor, so the application **Beagle Term** (serial monitor) goes hand-in-hand with it.

## Brainstorm
Currently, the plan is to create a horizontally-shaped pet food dispenser that utilizes an Archimedes screw design. The basic components of the design would be as follows:

* An Archimedes screw, rotated by a continuous rotation servo.

* A hole-shaped dispensing area for pouring the food into. The rate by which food was supplied to a pet would be determined by the speed of the continuous-rotation servo.

* An inclined plane for the food to travel on after being transported by the Archimedes screw. The inclined plane would lead to a pet food bowl or to a space where the pet could eat the food.
