# Pet Food Dispenser

# Overview
After completing the basic OnShape and CircuitPython assignments, the next asignnment was the first Engineering III project. The project did not have many contraints. Its main goal was to be a challenge. No specific task was given, but the project had to make use of CircuitPython and OnShape.

For the first Engineering III project, we decided to create a pet food dispenser. Both having pets, a pet food dispenser sounded like an applicable and fun idea. There were not many contraints on this project. The main constraint was that the project had to be challenging.

The tools that were used for this project are as follows:

* OnShape - OnShape was used for CAD (Computer-Aided Design). OnShape was helpful because it is a cloud-based program. Similar to GoogleDocs, it runs on "the web." Unlike Solidworks, another CAD program, OnShape allows for collaboration at the same time.

* PyCharm - PyCharm was used for CircuitPython. PyCharm is useful in that it is compatible with GitHub commits, pushes, and puls. It also has spell checks, a built-in serial monitor, and can suggest code improvements.

* Caret - Similar to PyCharm, Caret was used for CircuitPython. Note that **Caret is for Chromebook.** PyCharm operates only on Macs and PCs. For Chromebooks, Caret is a useful piece of software for programming in CircuitPython. It does not have a built-in serial monitor, so the application **Beagle Term** (a serial monitor) is useful to use with it.
