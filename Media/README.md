# Welcome to the Media folder

Inside of this folder are the sketches and diagrams which were used during the project brainstorm. The design ideas varied from an archimedes screw to using gears as gates to a food wheel. 

A challenge of this project was to be creative and work without instructions. A key takeaway from it is that engaging in brainstorming and creating sketches allows one to better visualize a project and develop a plan.

## Brainstorm Media

### Archimedes Screw

This was our original idea for the dispensing of the pet food. As the screw moves around, it pushes food down an inclined plane towards the bowl. We decided it would be diffucult to 3d print the screw and the cylinder around it, so we brainstormed about other ways we could dispense the food.
### Two Gears

Our second idea was to have two gears: one with a hole that would create a pathway when aligned with the hole on the wall, and another that would be attached to that gear and the 180 servo. The wheel would turn 90 degrees, stay for a few seconds to dispense the right amount, and then go back to its original position covering the hole. This design would easily crush the food pellets, and the weight put on the servo would be very heavy considering the weight of the pet food. Because of these reasons, we brainstormed again.
### Final Design - Water Wheel
