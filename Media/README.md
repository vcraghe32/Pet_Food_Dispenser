# Welcome to the Media folder

Inside this folder are the sketches and diagrams which were used during the project brainstorm. 
The design ideas varied from an archimedes screw to using gears as gates to a food wheel. 

A challenge of this project was to be creative and work without instructions. A key takeaway from it is that engaging 
in brainstorming and creating sketches makes it easier to visualize a project and develop a plan.

## Brainstorm Media

### Archimedes Screw

The Archimedes screw design was our original idea for creating a pet food dispenser. Here were the basic parts of this idea:

* A gate which opened up to an area where food could be stored for further use.

* An Archimedes screw be inclined so that the food serving size could be regulated. If the Archimedes screw tilted 
  downward or level, food would be pulled by gravity and be dispensed in an unregulated fashion.

* A slide-like part which would allow food to travel from the Archimedes screw onto a pet bowl.

### Two Gears

The two gears design was our second idea for creating a pet food dispenser. Here were the basic parts of this idea:

* A storage area which would be shaped so that food pellets would press against a gate-like structure.

* A gear attached to a gear attached to a servo. The servo would rotate the gear, and the gear would match up with 
  the gate-like structure at a specific orientation, allowing food pellets to flow out.


### Final Design - Water Wheel

The water wheel-like design is our third and, currently, final idea for creating a pet food dispenser. 
Here are the basic parts of this idea:

* A storage area or funnel, which is inclined so that food pellets have a gravitational inclination toward a hole at 
  the bottom. 

* A water wheel-like structure, which the food pellets fall into from the storage area or funnel. Note that the water 
  wheel-like structure has spaces in it which are cut out so that food can fall into them.

  * Additionally, a certain amount of food pellets would be dispensed per rotation, making measurement simpler.
  
* Some rubber hinge flaps, which are anchored to the funnel so that food does not overflow out of the water wheel-like 
  structure and spill.

* A slide-like structure where the food pellets would be dumped onto. The food pellets would then slide down the slide 
  and into a bowl. 

## Design Media For The Food Wheel

### Version 1

These are the measurements for the first (current) versions of our water wheel, hinge (for opening the battery holder/food container), and funnel walls.
