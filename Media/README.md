# Welcome to the Media folder

Inside of this folder are the sketches which were made during the project brainstorm. The design ideas varied from an archimedes screw to using gears as gates to a food wheel. 

A challenge of this project was to be creative and work without instructions. A key takeaway from it is that engaging in brainstorming and creating sketches allows one to better visualize a project and develop a plan.
