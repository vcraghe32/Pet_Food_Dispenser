# Welcome to the Media folder

Inside of this folder are the sketches and diagrams which were used during the project brainstorm. The design ideas varied from an archimedes screw to using gears as gates to a food wheel. 

A challenge of this project was to be creative and work without instructions. A key takeaway from it is that engaging in brainstorming and creating sketches allows one to better visualize a project and develop a plan.

## Brainstorm Media

### Archimedes Screw

This was our original idea for the dispensing of the pet food. As the screw moves around, it pushes food up an inclined plane and down a slide towards the bowl. 
### Two Gears

This image shows the sketch for the two gear design. As the wheel turns around by the force of the servo, the hole in the wheel and the hole on the wall would align and dispense the food.
### Final Design - Water Wheel

The food flows into the small containers inside the food wheel, and then moves in a circular motion with the pull of gravity and the push of a continuous rotation servo, and drops when the container faces downwards. The food is contained by rubber hinge flaps while it is being filled up to keep the small containers in the food wheel closed. When the wheel does a complete rotation a certain quanity of food is dispensed, so it is easy to measure and provide serving sizes. In addition, when the food drops from the small containers into the box, an inclined plane will bring the food down to the bowl. 
## Design Media 
### Version 1

These are the measurments for the first(current) versions of our water wheel, hinge(for opening the battery holder/food container), and funnel walls.
